<h1><b>Parse MODBUS Protocol</b></h1>

<h3><b>Author: Louis Huerta-Blake</b></h3>
<h4><b>README Last Edited: 7/8/2018</b><h4>

<h2><b><u>Summary</u></b></h2>

>Parses hexcode from the MODBUS protocol log generated by the prosoft card into readable table that states the line, id, function code and all other parameters assosciated with the code.

<h2><b><u>How It Works</u></b></h2>

> 1. The application starts the Javafx UI
> 2. Clicking browse opens up the OS's standard file search UI to select a txt file.
> 3. Assuming the correct text file is selected. Pressing the Parse button begins the process dependant on the mode selected
> 4. A scanner goes through line by line checking for the presence of a response or a request depending and begins to parse.
> 5. The parse class fills a hash map based on the function code. Which is then used to create a new serial data object
per response or request. For those that go multiple lines the object is created for each value.
> 6. The serial data is then printed out on the table shown in the center of the UI and can be sorted.


<h2><b><u>How To Use</u></b></h2>

> Download the parseMODBUS.jar file located in src. Just open the application to run

<h2><b><u>Looks</u></b></h2>

<h2><b><u>Dependencies</u></b></h2>

>* google guava v23.0


<h2><b><u>Version</u></b></h2>

>* 1.3 JAR File
>   * Created executable
>   * No longer need to reload app when selecting new mode or file
>   * All columns sortable
>* 1.2 App UI
>   * Now have new UI to select between Response and Request
>   * Data for response will be put into table on new UI. (request to follow soon)
>* 1.1 File Select
>   * Can now select file on application run, no longer need to manually change path in code
>   * Due to JDK 8, JFileChooser appears very tiny on high dpi screens. Will look into JavaFX at a later date.
>* 1.0 Parses all requests within the hexcode.txt file based on their function code
>   * only affects the [] values. <> are requests
>   * ability to to parse responses will be next followed by filtering
